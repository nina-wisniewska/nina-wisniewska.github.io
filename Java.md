Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications. It has been a popular choice among developers for over two decades, with millions of Java applications in use today. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.

The Java™ Programming Language is a general-purpose,
concurrent, strongly typed, class-based object-oriented language.
It is normally compiled to the bytecode instruction set and binary
format defined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification.

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc. in May 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to C/C++.

Java is an Object-Oriented programming language developed by James Gosling in the early 1990s. The team initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, television, etc. Originally C++ was considered to be used in the project but the idea was rejected for several reasons(For instance C++ required more memory). Gosling endeavoured to alter and expand C++ however before long surrendered that for making another stage called Green. James Gosling and his team called their project “Greentalk” and its file extension was .gt and later became to known as “OAK”.

Nowadays Java and C++ programming languages are vastly used in competitive coding. Due to some awesome features, these two programming languages are widely used in industries as well as comepetitive programming . C++ is a widely popular language among coders for its efficiency, high speed, and dynamic memory utilization. Java is widely used in the IT industry’s , It is incomparable to any other programming language in terms of software development. Let us go through the various points to compare these popular coding languages:
