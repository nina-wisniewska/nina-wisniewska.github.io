Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications. It has been a popular choice among developers for over two decades, with millions of Java applications in use today. Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.

The Java™ Programming Language is a general-purpose,
concurrent, strongly typed, class-based object-oriented language.
It is normally compiled to the bytecode instruction set and binary
format defined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification.

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc. in May 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to C/C++.

Nowadays Java and C++ programming languages are vastly used in competitive coding. Due to some awesome features, these two programming languages are widely used in industries as well as comepetitive programming . C++ is a widely popular language among coders for its efficiency, high speed, and dynamic memory utilization. Java is widely used in the IT industry’s , It is incomparable to any other programming language in terms of software development. Let us go through the various points to compare these popular coding languages:

If you are new to the world of coding and want to start your coding journey with Java, then this learn Java a beginners guide gives you a complete overview of how to start Java programming. Java is among the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms. A platform is an environment that helps to develop and run programs written in any programming language.

The meaning of Java platform-independent is that the Java compiled code(byte code) can run on all operating systems. A program is written in a language that is human-readable. It may contain words, phrases, etc. which the machine does not understand. For the source code to be understood by the machine, it needs to be in a language understood by machines, typically a machine-level language. So, here comes the role of a compiler. The compiler converts the high-level language (human language) into a format understood by the machines.

Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is an open-access software distribution that has a Java class library, specific tools, and a separate JVM. In Java, JRE is one of the interrelated components in the Java Development Kit (JDK). It is the most common environment available on devices for running Java programs. Java source code is compiled and converted to Java bytecode. If you want to run this bytecode on any platform, you need JRE. The JRE loads classes check memory access and get system resources. JRE acts as a software layer on top of the operating system.
